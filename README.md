# Toolhub Record Managemment and Editing Web Application

## Introduction
Toolhub is a catalog of tools hosted and managed by the wikimedia organization. This project as the name implies is a web application that gives interface for editing tools by supplying information that is missing in the tool. It's a project I carried out in the contribution phase for the [Outreachy December, 2022 Internship ](https://www.outreachy.org/outreachy-december-2022-internship-round/communities/wikimedia/create-a-web-application-for-editing-toolhub-recor/contributions/)
